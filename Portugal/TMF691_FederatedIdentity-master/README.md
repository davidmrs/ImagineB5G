# TMF691_FederatedIdentity
TM Forum Open APIs (Apache 2.0) Federated Identity Management API

Identity management is about the management of principals of any kind (persons, objects, …)
and their access to resources in an open environment which can span across different
enterprise boundaries. It relies on authentication, authorization and consent mechanisms
to protect privacy with a simple and easy user experience. Different parties can provide
identity services (operators, social networks, GSMA, …).
