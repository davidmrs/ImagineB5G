# TMF622_ProductOrder
TM Forum Open APIs (Apache 2.0) Product Order API

Provides a standardized mechanism for placing a product order with all of the necessary order parameters. The API consists of a simple set of operations that interact with CRM/Order negotiation systems in a consistent manner. A product order is created based on a product offering that is defined in a catalog. The product offering identifies the product or set of products that are available to a customer, and includes characteristics such as pricing, product options and market.
